EMBRYO-FETAL
TOXICITY
"Lenalidomide,"
a
thalidomide
"analogue,"
caused
limb
abnormalities
in
a
developmental
monkey
study
similar
to
birth
defects
caused
by
thalidomide
in
humans.
If
lenalidomide
is
used
during
"pregnancy,"
it
may
cause
birth
defects
or
embryo-fetal
death.
Pregnancy
must
be
excluded
before
start
of
treatment.
Prevent
pregnancy
during
treatment
by
the
use
of
two
reliable
methods
of
contraception
(5.1).
REVLIMID
is
available
only
through
a
restricted
distribution
"program,"
called
the
Lenalidomide
REMS
program
"(5.2,"
17).
HEMATOLOGIC
TOXICITY.REVLIMID
can
cause
significant
neutropenia
and
thrombocytopenia
(5.3).
VENOUS
AND
ARTERIAL
THROMBOEMBOLISM
Significantly
increased
risk
of
deep
vein
thrombosis
(DVT)
and
pulmonary
embolism
"(PE),"
as
well
as
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
and
stroke
in
patients
with
multiple
myeloma
receiving
REVLIMID
with
dexamethasone.
Anti-thrombotic
prophylaxis
is
recommended
(5.4).
